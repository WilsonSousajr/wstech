    "bio": "I'm Wilson Sousa, a Backend Software Engineer based in Brasilia, Brazil. I specialize in building scalable distributed systems, high-performance APIs, and data pipelines. My daily tools include Python, FastAPI, Django, and Go, backed by PostgreSQL and ClickHouse for data storage and analytics.\n\nBeyond backend development, I have hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure — managing deployments on AWS, VPS, and bare metal servers. I enjoy the full lifecycle: from designing system architecture to deploying and monitoring production workloads.\n\nWhen I'm not writing code, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, and sharing what I learn through my blog.",
