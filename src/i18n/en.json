    "bio": "I'm Wilson Sousa, a Backend Software Engineer based in Brasilia, Brazil. I specialize in engineering high-concurrency distributed systems and scalable microservices, focused in Python (FastAPI, Django) and Hybrid Cloud Architectures.\n\nI have a proven track record of optimizing system performance from reducing storage infrastructure costs by 97% through compression, to deploying production-grade API ecosystems. I'm experienced with database tuning (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse), asynchronous programming, and building RAG systems with LLM integration.\n\nCurrently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Universidade de Brasilia (UnB). When I'm not writing code, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, and sharing what I learn through my blog.",
